# 🇵🇰 Rozgar Chain

## Secure Freelance Payments on Base Blockchain

Rozgar Chain 


## Problem

Pakistani freelancers face serious payment issues:
- Clients don't pay after work is completed
- Late payments are common
- No trust between clients and freelancers
- Disputes waste time and money

**Over 1 million Pakistani freelancers face these challenges daily.**


## Solution

**Rozgar Chain** uses blockchain escrow to guarantee payments:

1. **Client Creates Gig** → Deposits payment into smart contract
2. **Freelancer Works** → Money is locked and visible
3. **Client Approves** → Payment automatically releases

No trust needed. Code handles everything.
